# Push Swap (with bonus)

## The project
The Push swap project is about creating a C program that sorts a set of integers using two stacks. 
The challenge is to find the most efficient way to sort these integers, considering the complexity of sorting algorithms. 
The focus is on mastering C programming, algorithmic thinking, and optimizing sorting efficiency.

## Usage 
- Compile with `make`
- Run the program with a list of integers, like `./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8`, to get the sorting instructions.
- Compile the checker with `make bonus` to validate the sorting steps. Use it by running (e.g., ./checker 5 1 9), then input operations (e.g., sa), and finish with ctrl-d to check the result.

## Requirements
- Make
- gcc
